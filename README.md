# reactos-testing-scripts

React OS is a free software project to develop a free clone of MS-Windows.

See: https://www.reactos.org

React OS is still in alpha state, although many things work right now. But it needs a lot of work. I no nothing about the Windows internals, so I try to help by testing it. These are some scripts that I am using to help to test React OS. I share them on github, just in case you find them useful.

* create_reactos_virtual_machine.py

In my opinion, the best way to test react os, is by using a virtual machine. However, downloading the iso file, decompressing it and setting the virtual machine is a rather tedious process. So have developed this script in order to automate it.
